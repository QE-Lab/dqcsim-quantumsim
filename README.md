# DQCsim backend wrapper for QuantumSim

See also: [DQCsim](https://github.com/mbrobbel/dqcsim) and
[QuantumSim](https://gitlab.com/quantumsim/quantumsim).

This is VERY alpha right now, built for DQCsim 0.0.2 and QuantumSim 0.2.0 and
hardly tested. No error modelling is supported yet, this is just a dumb wrapper
that can execute one- and two-qubit gates received from the upstream plugin
using QuantumSim.

USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.

License is GPL, since QuantumSim's license is GPL.
